# Room Persistence Library
https://developer.android.com/training/data-storage/room/index.html

The library provides an abstraction layer over [[SQLite Database]].

The library creates a cache of your app's data on a device that's running your app. This cache, which serves as your app's *single source of truth*, allows users to view a consistent copy of key information within your app, regardless of whether users have an internet connection.
